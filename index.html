<p>Hello friends here is some sort of try for parsing the json data and using the result in our  android application.
First of all we need to learn what json is ?
well json is the format in which we share data between  platforms and applications and servers,JSON format is universal and accepted 
and supported by many languages such as java,.net,python,php,rubby,etc.
This does same wordk as XML does but it has replaced xml since 2-3 year ,as it is fast and reliable .for further information regarding json please refer to wikki or google it .   </p>

<p>JSON parsing include a web call  from your application and then on getting response in json format we need to parse it in to you required java format (Android).
For doing that we need to understand the mechanism  behind this ,in andorid application there several types of thread where the common and important one is UI(Main) Thread where application interacts with users , generally it is recomnded to no to perform network operations or lengthy operations on the main thread ,so we use background thread .To do so we can use many approaches but here i have used aync task ,which can be used to perform the operation on the backgroud </p>

<p>We can also use some beautiful third party apis for performing such length and complicated network operations ,there are many apis such as GSON,Retrofit,Volley etc...
I have used Retrofit here as it easy to understand and use . </p>
